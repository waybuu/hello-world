# hello-world
My first respoitory on GitHub to start learning and to put some stuff in!
I'm pretty new at this stuff and feel somewhat intimidated to join Github because I have no idea what I'm here for! That said, I found some code on Github that solved a problem with my website! :) yayyyy! I wonder if I'll ever be able to write some computer code?
